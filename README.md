# Skatepark Simulation in MATLAB

This project is a **skatepark simulation** created in **MATLAB** for the course **Introduction to Mathematical and Numerical Methods** during my second year of university.

### About the Project

The objective of this assignment was to create a simulation of a skatepark using only mathematical operations in MATLAB. This project helped me develop my skills in mathematical modeling and numerical methods, while also allowing me to explore the capabilities of MATLAB for simulations.

### Features
- Simulation of a skatepark environment.
- Developed using mathematical operations in MATLAB.
- Focus on mathematical modeling and numerical techniques.

### Technologies
- **MATLAB**
